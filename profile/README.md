# Hi there 👋

> Welcome to our Robotics, and Software Development focused GitHub organization based in the beautiful Austrian Alps.

## 🧙‍♂️ Who are we?

We're a group of tech enthusiasts who are passionate about exploring the endless possibilities of technology and its potential to shape the future. Our team of students and developers is dedicated to learning, creating and understanding technology and developing solutions for various situations.

## 🤖 Whats our mission?

With the stunning backdrop of the Austrian Alps, we bring together modern technology and the beauty of nature to create something exceptional.

We focus on teaching robotics, IoT and software development to the students of the [HTL Dornbirn](https://htldornbirn.at).
By combining multiple different types of lessons students can learn to apply programming skills to various fields, such as robotics, AI, game development, and web design. They can also develop problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and creativity, which are essential for success in any industry.

So, if you're interested in being a part of our journey, join us as we work towards making an impact on our student body through our work. Feel free to explore our repositories and connect with us if you'd like to collaborate or have any questions.
